This repository is a replication of the article "Interrupted Time Series regression for the evaluation of public health interventions: a tutorial." It provides a detailed methodology for analyzing the effects of interventions implemented at specific points in time. The tutorial covers the ITS design choice, proposing an impact model, statistical analysis using segmented regression, and addresses methodological issues like autocorrelation, seasonal trends, and controlling for confounders. It uses a case study on the Italian smoking ban's impact on hospital admissions to illustrate the approach​​.
